Repository for the 3rd programming assignment of UW-Madison CS540 Summer 2020 course (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)


## Goals
We are required to build and simulate a simple **Markov chain model** based on a movie script.
We are going to use the model in order to generate new sentences.
Moreover, we are required to build a **Naive Bayes classifier** to distinguish sentences from the script and sentences from a fake script.  
To mitigate the problem caused by the size of English vocabularies (more than 170,000 words), we will use characters (26 characters) as feature instead of words.
